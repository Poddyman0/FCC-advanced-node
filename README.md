Project Title: Real-Time Chat Application with Authentication

Description:
I developed a real-time chat application with secure user authentication using Node.js and Express.js. The application enables users to register, log in, and participate in live chat rooms. Passport.js was used to handle authentication, and Pug was integrated for creating dynamic and reusable templates. Real-time messaging is powered by WebSockets using Socket.IO.

Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for routing and server-side logic.
Passport.js: Middleware for user authentication and session management.
Pug: Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
Socket.IO: Library for real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.
bcryptjs: Library for securely hashing user passwords.
connect-flash: Middleware for displaying flash messages (e.g., error or success notifications).
Features:

User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality with Passport.js for managing user sessions.
Real-Time Chat: Live chat functionality powered by WebSockets, allowing instant message sending and receiving.
Dynamic Templates: Reusable and consistent front-end templates designed using Pug for a seamless user experience.
Flash Messages: Flash messages provide instant feedback during user registration, login, and other actions.
Static and Real-Time Content: The application serves both static content and real-time updates, keeping users engaged with the latest information.
